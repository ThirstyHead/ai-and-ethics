The "DOCTOR" script written for ELIZA was programmed to respond to questions as a psychotherapist would. For example, ELIZA would say, "Please tell me your problem." If the user input "Men are all alike," the program would respond, "In what way."

The script is 420 lines.

Weizenbaum wrote ELIZA in a now-defunct programming language he invented, called Michigan Algorithm Decoder Symmetric List Processor (MAD-SLIP), but it was almost immediately copied into the language Lisp.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropomorphism


"Computer Power and Human Reason: From Judgment to Calculation" by Joseph Weizenbaum, a classic work exploring the ethical implications of computers and AI, argues that while computers can be powerful tools, they should not be seen as replacements for human judgment and ethical decision-making. 
Here's a more detailed review:
Central Argument:
Weizenbaum, a pioneer in AI and creator of the chatbot Eliza, contends that despite their capabilities, computers are fundamentally different from humans and cannot replicate human judgment, creativity, or moral reasoning. 
Ethical Concerns:
The book raises important ethical questions about the use of computers in areas like decision-making, problem-solving, and even in therapeutic settings. 
Focus on Human Qualities:
Weizenbaum emphasizes the unique human qualities that computers lack, such as intuition, empathy, and the ability to make nuanced judgments based on context and experience

AI ethics addresses the moral issues arising from the development and use of artificial intelligence, focusing on fairness, transparency, accountability, and the potential for bias and misuse. [1, 2]  
Here's a more detailed look at key aspects of AI ethics: [3, 4]  
Core Principles and Concerns: [3, 4]  

• Fairness and Non-Discrimination: AI systems should not perpetuate or amplify existing societal biases, leading to unfair or discriminatory outcomes. [3, 4]  
• Transparency and Explainability: Users should understand how AI systems make decisions, and the reasoning behind their outputs, fostering trust and accountability. [5]  
• Accountability: Clear lines of responsibility should be established for AI systems' actions, ensuring that individuals or organizations are held responsible for any harm caused. [6]  
• Data Privacy and Security: AI systems must handle data responsibly and ethically, respecting user privacy and protecting sensitive information. [1, 7]  
• Human Autonomy and Control: AI should augment human capabilities, not replace them, and users should retain control over their interactions with AI systems. [8]  
• Bias Mitigation: AI models can be trained on biased data, leading to unfair outcomes. Techniques and strategies are needed to identify, reduce, and prevent biases in AI models. [9, 10]  
• Environmental Sustainability: The development and deployment of AI should consider its environmental impact, promoting sustainable practices. [1]  
• Inclusion and Equity: AI systems should be designed to benefit all users, regardless of their background or identity, promoting equity and accessibility. [11, 12]  
• Moral Agency: AI systems should be designed to align with human values and promote ethical behavior. [1]  
• Value Alignment: AI systems should be designed to achieve desired outcomes while adhering to ethical principles. [1]  
• Trust and Safety: Ensuring that AI systems are safe, reliable, and trustworthy is crucial for public acceptance and adoption. [1, 8]  
• Technology Misuse: AI technologies should not be used for malicious or harmful purposes. [1]  

Examples of AI Ethics Issues: [3, 4]  

• Algorithmic Bias: AI models trained on biased data can perpetuate or amplify existing societal biases. [3, 4]  
• Privacy Violations: AI systems that collect and analyze personal data can raise privacy concerns. [7, 13]  
• Job Displacement: Automation powered by AI can lead to job losses in certain sectors. [14]  
• Autonomous Weapons: The development and deployment of autonomous weapons raise serious ethical concerns about accountability and the potential for unintended consequences. [6]  
• Manipulation and Persuasion: AI can be used to manipulate or persuade individuals, raising ethical questions about autonomy and free will. [2]  
• Surveillance: AI-powered surveillance systems can raise concerns about privacy and the potential for misuse. [2]  

Organizations and Initiatives: [15, 16]  

• Microsoft: Has a dedicated AI Ethics board to oversee projects and ensure they align with transparency, fairness, and human-centered values. [15, 16]  
• IBM: Emphasizes the importance of trust and transparency in AI, with guidelines for ethical AI development and deployment. [1, 17]  
• UNESCO: Has developed a Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence, providing a framework for ethical AI development and deployment. [18]  
• AI for Europe: Is a European Commission initiative aimed at promoting the development and deployment of trustworthy AI. [6]  

Generative AI is experimental.
