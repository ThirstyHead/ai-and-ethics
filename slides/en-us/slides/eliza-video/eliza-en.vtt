00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:04.259

Wiseman discovered when he created Eliza

5
00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:12.929
Eliza is a computer program that anyone

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.730
can converse with via the keyboard and

7
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.310
it'll reply on the screen we've added

8
00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.720
human speech to make the conversation

computers replies seem very

20
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.039
understanding but this program is merely

21
00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.199
triggered by certain phrases to come up

22
00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.649
with stock responses nevertheless

keyboard and she began to tighten of

27
00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.740

28
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:11.970
make sure that everything was operating

29
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.400

bounded that Eliza didn't understand a

34
00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.590
single word that was being typed into it

35
00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.320
