ELIZA: Is something troubling you ?
YOU: Men are all alike.
ELIZA: What is the connection, do you suppose ?
YOU: They're always bugging us about something or other.
ELIZA: Can you think of a specific example ?
YOU: Well, my boyfriend made me come here.
ELIZA: Is it important to you that your boyfriend made 
you come here ?
YOU: He says I'm depressed much of the time.
ELIZA: I am sorry to hear that you are depressed.
YOU: It's true. I am unhappy.
ELIZA: Can you explain what made you unhappy ?
